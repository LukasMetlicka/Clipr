#Clipr.
##The first online clip solution.
Ever been helping a friend debug his code and wish you could access those little snippets of code you keep in a .txt file on your desktop so you don't have to spend so much time typing?  An awnser to your problem has come.  Clipr utilizes login authentication and several databases so that you can easily and securely create clips that can be accessed anywhere.  Clips use a hashtag system to organize clips, so that they can be easily grouped for later use.  Your clips can be viewed on your home page, which displays your clips for ease of copying.  Additionally, the home page includes a hotbar, where using ⌘1, ⌘2, and ⌘3 (windows key on windows machines) will copy that clip's contents to your computer's clipboard.
